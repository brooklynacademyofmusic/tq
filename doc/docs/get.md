Sample:  CRM/Constituents/Search?type=fluent&amp;q=Huff
Single Line search type (or fluent) is the default search if not provided in querystring.  Single line search works on string patterns in the passed search value ("q" param).  Patterns are as follows:
	Value contains only alpha characters - interpreted as a last name search.  To search with first name, pass comma then additional search value ("last, first").
	Text enclosed in quotes is interpreted as a search for name ("ACE 123 Corporation").
	value containing an @ symbol is interpreted as an email address.
	Value starting with # is interpreted as a phone number search.
	Value containing alpha and numeric characters is interpreted as a postal code.  UK and other countries should omit spaces for postal code search values.
Basic search type permits parameters constituentId, ln, fn, street, and post. Sample URL: CRM/Constituents/Search?type=basic&amp;ln=Huff&amp;fn=Frank&amp;post=20746
Advanced search type permits parameters atype, op, and value. Sample URL:  CRM/Constituents/Search?type=advanced&amp;atype=Email&amp;op=Like&amp;value=%25@gmail.com
Attribute search type permits parameters key, op, value. Sample URL:  CRM/Constituents/Search?type=attribute&amp;key=Board+Affiliation&amp;op=Equals&amp;value=Association+Member
